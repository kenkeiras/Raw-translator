API:

To use the api, query *api.php* including at least the parameter *op* ( operation ) vÃ­a GET ( when possible ) or POST, available options are:
    *get_translations*: returns the possible origin -> result combinations.
    *add_to_database*: adds a translation file to database ( currently PO files suported, working on MO suport ).
    *translate*: translates a PO file.
    *translate_string*: translates a single string.

Translation is always needed  except when calling *get_translations* ), passed as the *trans* argument.
When a file is sent, it must be throught a POST query, with the file as *file*, elsewhere both GET or POST can be used.
When translating a single string, it must be sent URL encoded as the *str* parameter.
When a file is going to be translated, if a parameter *add* is sent ( with any content ), it will add the translations to the database.
